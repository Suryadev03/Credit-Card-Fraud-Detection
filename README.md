# Credit-card-fraud-detection

This project demonstrates a combination of data analysis, machine learning, and interactive web application development skills. It utilizes Python libraries like Pandas and NumPy for data manipulation, Scikit-learn for model building and evaluation, and Streamlit for creating an intuitive user interface. Visualization tools such as Matplotlib and Seaborn are used to present insights like the confusion matrix. 

This Streamlit app is a user-friendly solution for detecting fraudulent credit card transactions using machine learning. It allows users to upload a dataset, preprocesses the data, and trains a Random Forest Classifier to classify transactions as fraudulent or non-fraudulent. The app provides performance metrics like a classification report and confusion matrix for evaluation. Additionally, users can input custom data for instant predictions, making it a practical tool for fraud detection.
